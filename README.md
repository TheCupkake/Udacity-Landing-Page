## Description

This is my implementation of the ***Udacity*** landing page project, it is built from the starting skeleton static page provided by the course, and built upon it to make it dynamic, it is responsive to various devices. It demonstrates the following features: 

- Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list. Start with empty ul and dynamically build navigation using Append, appendChild, and innerHTML.

- It is clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.

- When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the appropriate section.

- Styling has been added for active states.

- All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.



## Usage

The usage of this project is to demonstrate how you can transform a static webpage into a dynamic one using primarily JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and listen to events and respond to them

## Languages Used

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

## Development 

I have mainly relied on the course material and the lessons provided by the instructors to complete this project, but I have also searched online for documentation for functions and methods that weren't mentioned in the course material but were necessary for certain functionalities, such as the function getBoundingClientRect() to add the active states.
